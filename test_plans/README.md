This directory contains test plans for new features in SYCL 2020.  A test plan
is simply a description of the tests that we plan to add to the CTS.  Since the
test plans are more concise than the actual test, we can review and change them
more quickly that reviewing and changing the actual tests.  Once a plan has
been approved, we can write the tests according to the plan.

Test plans do not have a strict format.  A plan should have enough information
to tell which APIs will be tested and to explain how they will be tested.  The
goal of a plan is to get feedback, so include enough detail for the reader to
understand the core purpose of each test.  Most test plans have one section
for each test, and each section has a bulleted list that describes that test.
When writing a new test plan, it's often easiest to use an existing plan as a
model.
