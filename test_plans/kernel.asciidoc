= Test plan for sycl::kernel (cover gaps)

This is a test plan cover sycl::kernel functionality that is not covered by current tests.

== Testing scope

Tests intend to cover functions from 4.11.13. The kernel class that are not covered in https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SYCL-CTS/tree/main/tests/kernel

=== Device coverage

All of the tests described below are performed only on the default device that
is selected on the CTS command line.

== Tests

To get kernel object:

* Define a simple kernel named `KernelName` that uses no optional features.
* Obtain a kernel bundle in executable state that contains this kernel via
`get_kernel_bundle<KernelName, bundle_state::executable(const context&, const device&)`.
* Get a kernel object for the kernel by calling `kernel_bundle::get_kernel<KernelName>()`.

=== Deleted default constructor

Check that std::is_default_constructible_v<sycl::kernel> is `false`.

=== Test for `get_backend()`

Call function `kernel::get_backend()` and check that return type is `sycl::backend`.

Note: `template <typename Param> typename Param::return_type get_backend_info()` is not tested since `Param` should be defined by backend.

=== Test for `get_info(const device &dev)`

Call `get_info<Param>(current_device)` and check that return type is `uint32_t` for following `Param`:

* info::kernel_device_specific::max_num_sub_groups

* info::kernel_device_specific::compile_num_sub_groups

* info::kernel_device_specific::max_sub_group_size

* info::kernel_device_specific::compile_sub_group_size
