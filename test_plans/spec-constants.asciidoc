= Test plan for specialization constants

This is a test plan for the APIs described in SYCL 2020 section 4.9.5.
"Specialization constants" and for the
`kernel_bundle::set_specialization_constant()` and
`kernel_bundle::get_specialization_constant()` APIs that are described
in section 4.11.12.2. "Specialization constant support".

== Testing scope

=== Device coverage

All of the tests described below are performed only on the default device that
is selected on the CTS command line.

[[sec:types]]
=== Specialization constant types

All of tests described below (with the exception of those tests described under
"Tests which are not run for all types") are performed using each of the
following types as the underlying type of a `specialization_id` variable.

* `char`
* `signed char`
* `unsigned char`
* `short int`
* `unsigned short int`
* `int`
* `unsigned int`
* `long int`
* `unsigned long int`
* `long long int`
* `unsigned long long int`
* `float`
* `bool`
* `std::byte`
* `std::int8_t`
* `std::int16_t`
* `std::int32_t`
* `std::int64_t`
* `std::uint8_t`
* `std::uint16_t`
* `std::uint32_t`
* `std::uint64_t`
* `std::size_t`
* `vec<T, int dim>` where `T` is each of the scalar types listed above except
   for `bool` and `dim` is `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `8`, and `16`.
* `marray<T, size_t dim>` where `T` is each of the scalar types listed above
  and `dim` is `2`, `5`, and `10`.

  constructor, and a user-defined (non-default) constructor.

In addition, if the device has `aspect::fp64`, the following types are tested:

* `double`
* `vec<double, int dim>` where `dim` is `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `8`, and `16`.

* `marray<sycl::half, size_t dim>` where `dim` is `2`, `5`, and `10`.


== Tests

=== Basic tests with handler

All of the following basic tests have these initial steps:

* Declare a `specialization_id` variable in the global namespace for the
  tested type.  The variable's default value has some non-zero value.
* Create a `queue` from the tested device and call `queue::submit()`.

==== Read a spec constant from a handler without writing its value

* Call `handler::get_specialization_constant()` and make sure we get the
  default value.
* No kernel is submitted.

==== Write and read a spec constant from a handler

* Set the value of the spec constant via
  `handler::set_specialization_constant()`.
* Call `handler::get_specialization_constant()` and make sure we get the same
  value back.
* No kernel is submitted.

==== Write the value twice from a handler and make sure we read the second value

* Set the value of the spec constant via
  `handler::set_specialization_constant()`.
* Set the value again to a different value.
* Call `handler::get_specialization_constant()` and make sure we get the second
  value back.
* No kernel is submitted.

==== Read a spec constant from a kernel without writing its value

* Submit a kernel via `handler::single_task()`.
* Read the value of the spec constant via
  `kernel_handler::get_specialization_constant()` and make sure we get the
   default value back.

==== Write the value from a handler and read it from a kernel

* Set the value of the spec constant via
  `handler::set_specialization_constant()`.
* Submit a kernel via `handler::single_task()`.
* Read the value of the spec constant via
  `kernel_handler::get_specialization_constant()` and make sure we get the same
   value back.

==== Write the value twice from a handler and read it from a kernel

* Set the value of the spec constant via
  `handler::set_specialization_constant()`.
* Set the value again to a different value.
* Submit a kernel via `handler::single_task()`.
* Read the value of the spec constant via
  `kernel_handler::get_specialization_constant()` and make sure we get the second
   value back.

==== Write the value from a handler and read it twice from a kernel

* Set the value of the spec constant via
  `handler::set_specialization_constant()`.
* Submit a kernel via `handler::single_task()`.
* Read the value of the spec constant twice via
  `kernel_handler::get_specialization_constant()` and make sure that each time
  we get that value that was written.

[[sec:hander-by-ref]]
==== Pass kernel handler object by reference to another function

* Set the value of the spec constant via
  `handler::set_specialization_constant()`.
* Submit a kernel via `handler::single_task()`.
* Call some helper function in the same translation unit, passing the
  `kernel_handler` object by reference.
* From the helper function, read the value of the spec constant via
  `kernel_handler::get_specialization_constant()` and make sure we get the same
   value back.

==== Pass kernel handler object by value to another function

* Same test as in <<sec:hander-by-ref>>, except pass the `kernel_handler`
  object by value.

[[sec:external-handler-by-ref]]
==== Pass kernel handler object by reference to a `SYCL_EXTERNAL` function

* This test runs only if the implementation defines `SYCL_EXTERNAL`.
* Same test as in <<sec:hander-by-ref>> except:
  - The helper function is defined in a separate translation unit via
    `SYCL_EXTERNAL`.
  - The separate translation unit has an external declaration for the
    `specialization_id` variable, which is defined in the first translation
    unit.

==== Pass kernel handler object by value to a `SYCL_EXTERNAL` function

* This test runs only if the implementation defines `SYCL_EXTERNAL`.
* Same test as in <<sec:external-handler-by-ref>>, except pass the
  `kernel_handler` object by value.

[[sec:multiple]]
=== Multiple spec constants

* Declare several `specialization_id` variables of the tested type in the
  global namespace.  All the default values are different and none are zero.

* Set the values of some of the spec constants via
  `handler::set_specialization_constant()` but do not set the values for all of
  them.
* Submit a kernel via `handler::single_task()`.
* Read the values of the spec constant via
  `kernel_handler::get_specialization_constant()` and make sure we get the
  expected value from each (either the value we set or the default value).

=== Multiple spec constants with `kernel_bundle`

* Same test as in <<sec:multiple>>, except set spec constants in a
  `kernel_bundle`, build the bundle and register the bundle with a handler.

[[sec:two-command]]
=== Two command groups that read the same spec constant, both set value

* Declare a `specialization_id` variable in the global namespace for the
  tested type.  The variable's default value has some non-zero value.
* Declare a single object whose type is a class with `operator(handler &)`.
  This object will be the command group handler for our test.
* Create a `queue` from the tested device and call `queue::submit()` twice.
  Each call passes the same command group handler object described above.
* Each command group handler sets the value of the spec constant to a
  different value.
* Each command group handler submits a kernel via `handler::single_task()`.
* Each kernel reads the spec constant via
  `kernel_handler::get_specialization_constant()`.
* Verify that the value read in the kernel is the same as the value set in
  the command group handler which launched that kernel instance.
* The two kernels should run in parallel for this test.

=== Two command groups that read the same spec constant, only one sets value

Same test as in <<sec:two-command>> except only one of the command group
handlers sets the value of the spec constant.  The kernel instance that is
launched from the handler that does not set a value should read the spec
constant's default value.

[[sec:declarations]]

Instead, each of these tests specifies the type of the specialization constant.

==== Class with a member function that accesses members

* Declare a type that is a class with at least one member variable and a member
  function which accesses that member variable.  For example:

```
struct myType {
  int a, b;
  constexpr myType(int a, int b) : a(a), b(b) {}
  int calculate(int c) const { return a * b * c; }
};
```

  namespace.

  `handler::set_specialization_constant()`.
* Submit a kernel via `handler::single_task()`.
* Read the value of the spec constant via
  `kernel_handler::get_specialization_constant()`.  This will return an object
  of the tested type (i.e. `myType`).
* Call the member function on that object (i.e. `myType::calculate()`).
* Verify the return value of the member function to make sure it executed
  correctly.
