= Test plan for sycl_ext_oneapi_num_compute_units

This is a test plan for the APIs described in
https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/sycl/sycl/doc/extensions/supported/sycl_ext_oneapi_num_compute_units.asciidoc[sycl_ext_oneapi_num_compute_units].

== Testing scope

=== Device coverage

All of the tests described below are performed only on the default device that
is selected on the CTS command line.

=== Feature test macro

All of the tests should use `#ifdef SYCL_EXT_ONEAPI_NUM_COMPUTE_UNITS` so they
can be skipped if feature is not supported.

== Tests

The extension introduces a new device descriptor: `sycl::ext::oneapi::info::device::num_compute_units`.

For this device descriptor, execute `sycl::device::get_info` and check that the following statements are true:

1. the return type of `sycl::device::get_info` call is expected, it should be `size_t`,
2. the return value of `sycl::device::get_info` call should be greater than or equal to `1`.
