This document is intended as a comprehensive reference for developers wanting to contribute to the Khronos SYCL Conformance Test Suite.

NOTE: This document is still a work-in-progress.
Pull requests are welcome!
If you are uncertain how to approach a task while developing for the CTS, and it is not covered by this document, please link:https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SYCL-CTS/issues/new[open an issue].

== General

The SYCL CTS is a C++17 application that uses https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/[Catch2] as its underlying testing framework.

=== Directory Structure

After first cloning the repository, you will find the following directory structure:

[listing]
----
SYCL-CTS
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ci
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cmake
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ oclmath
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_plans
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ common
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <test categories>
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tools
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ util
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vendor
----

The link:../.github[`.github`], link:../ci[`ci`] and link:../docker[`docker`] folders contain files related to the continuous integration setup, such as workflow definitions, testing containers and per SYCL implementation test category filters.
For more information, see <<Continuous Integration (CI)>>.

The link:../cmake[`cmake`] folder contains helper functions and find modules for all supported SYCL implementations.
You may find it helpful to browse these files if you run into problems configuring the CTS for a given SYCL implementation.

link:../oclmath[`oclmath`] contains reference implementations for many of the math functions provided by the SYCL API.
To ensure the correct behavior of the latter, they are compared against these reference implementations, which were borrowed from the https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-CTS[Khronos OpenCL CTS].

The link:../test_plans[`test_plans`] directory contains documents describing in detail how certain SYCL features are to be tested.
See <<Test Plans>> for more information.

The link:../tests[`tests`] directory lies at the heart of the SYCL CTS.
It contains many subfolders, one for each <<Test Categories,test category>>.
Additionally, it contains a link:../tests/common[`common`] directory with header-only functionalities that are shared between many or all test cases.

Similarly to link:../tests/common[`tests/common`], the link:../util[`util`] folder contains functionality shared by many of the tests in the CTS.
It also contains framework-level functionality that underpins the execution of the CTS, for example device selection logic.

TIP: The distinction between `util` and `tests/common` is blurry and we may revise this structure in the future.
If you are unsure where to put new functionality, consider whether it requires a separate translation unit (`.cpp` file).
If so, move it to `util`; otherwise check if either of the two folders already contains similar/related functionality, and move it there.

=== Test Categories

Test cases in the SYCL CTS are grouped into _categories_.
Each folder in the link:../tests[`tests`] directory corresponds to one such category.
Each category is comprised of one or more translation units and is compiled into a single test executable, named `test_<category>`.

TIP: Before adding a test case, consider whether there already exists a category it would fit into, or whether a new category is required.

TIP: The CTS supports disabling the compilation of entire categories for certain SYCL implementations.
See <<Procedures>> for more information.

== Procedures

NOTE: #**TODO:** Explain supporting multiple SYCL implementations (test category filters, compile-time macros).#

=== Test Plans

For SYCL 2020, the SYCL CTS has adopted _test plans_ as a way of planning how a given feature is going to be tested.
Using test plans, you can get feedback on your planned testing approach and scope without spending effort on code that may then have to be changed during review.

You can find existing test plans in the link:../test_plans[`test_plans`] directory.

TIP: Consider creating a test plan when tackling a new test category.
For smaller contributions, such as the addition of a new test case to an existing test category, the creation of a test plan can usually be skipped.

=== Pull Requests

The SYCL CTS uses pull requests and code reviews before merging any changes, including test cases, bugfixes and improvements to the testing infrastructure.

Before a pull request can be merged, the following steps need to be addressed:

. To be able to contribute code to the SYCL CTS, you will have to sign the link:https://cla-assistant.io/KhronosGroup/SYCL-CTS[Khronos Open Source Contributer License Agreement (CLA)].
. All CI checks must be green.
. A pull request requires at least one review approval from a Khronos member.
.. If you work for an organization that is a Khronos member, at least one approval from a different member is required.

Merging is done by the author of the pull request or someone from the same organization (for Khronos members), or by @bader or @psalz for third party contributions.

TIP: Bumping the version of a SYCL implementation used in CI requires no review approvals if the PR was opened by the respective implementer.
See <<Continuous Integration (CI)>> for more information.

=== Continuous Integration (CI)

To ensure that the SYCL CTS remains compatible with all three supported SYCL implementations, a continuous integration (CI) pipeline is run on every pull request.
To pass the pipeline, the CTS needs to compile for all SYCL implementations.
If this is not feasible, parts of the CTS may have to be compile-time disabled.
See <<Disabling Test Categories>> and <<Compile-Time Disabled Test Cases>> for more information.

IMPORTANT: The CTS is currently only _compiled_ during CI, but not _executed_.
This means that passing CI does not imply anything about the quality of your testing logic.

Compilation takes place inside of Docker containers, with a separate container used for each SYCL implementation.
The container images are available at the link:https://hub.docker.com/r/khronosgroup/sycl-cts-ci[Khronos DockerHub repository] and the corresponding Dockerfiles can be found in the link:../docker[`docker`] directory.

TIP: Using the CTS CI container images locally can be a quick and easy way to spin up a working development environment when debugging an issue for a given SYCL implementation.

==== Disabling Test Categories

As the CTS and different SYCL implementations are being independently developed, it is not always possible to guarantee that all tests compile for all SYCL implementations.
To enable the CI pipeline to discover actual bugs and regressions while ignoring cases that are known to be non-working, the CTS allows to disable the compilation of entire test categories during CMake configuration time.

To disable one or more test categories, simply configure the CTS with the option `-DSYCL_CTS_EXCLUDE_TEST_CATEGORIES=<filter-file>`,
where `<filter-file>` is a file containing a list of categories to ignore.

A test category filter for each SYCL implementation corresponding to the version currently tested in CI can be found in the link:../ci[`ci`] directory.

TIP: While test category filters provide a convenient way of ensuring the CTS passes CI, it can be a heavy-handed approach in scenarios where only _some_ parts of a category don't compile for a given implementation.
To address this issue, the CTS offers finer-grained control over which parts of a test are being compiled through <<Compile-Time Disabled Test Cases>>.

==== Updating a SYCL Implementation's Version

The version of each SYCL implementation is specified in the link:../.github/workflows/cts_ci.yml[GitHub workflow definition file].

The GitHub actions workflow needs to interact with DockerHub to push new Docker images for use in subsequent CI runs.
This requires credentials that, for security reasons, are only available to the workflow when it is run on a branch in the main repository, not from a fork.

IMPORTANT: To update the version of a SYCL implementation, always push the commit to the main CTS repository directly.

TIP: After updating the version of a SYCL implementation, the category filters should be regenerated.
To do so, simply run `ci/generate_exclude_filter.py`.

== Coding Guidelines

=== Code Style

The CTS uses clang-format to ensure a consistent coding style.
While some parts of the CTS are not yet formatted according to clang-format, all new additions and modifications must be.

IMPORTANT: Please format your code using `clang-format` before submitting a pull request.
However, make sure to only format the parts that you actually modified (for example using `clang-format-diff.py`), to avoid noise in your patch.

=== Copyright Header

Each file in the SYCL CTS should be prefaced by the Khronos copyright header:

== Writing Tests

This section contains guidelines on how to write test cases for the SYCL CTS.
We recommend that you try and stick to these guidelines, however, they are not to be considered hard and fast rules, and best practices are still being developed.

=== Setting up a Simple Category & Test Case

To create a new test category create the following files inside the link:../tests[`tests`] directory:

```
tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ simple
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CMakeLists.txt
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ simple.cpp
```

In `tests/simple/CMakeLists.txt` add the following boilerplate:

[source,cmake]
----
file(GLOB test_cases_list *.cpp)
add_cts_test(${test_cases_list})
----

Then in `tests/simple/simple.cpp` add the following:

[source,c++]
----
#include "../common/common.h"

TEST_CASE("a simple test case", "[simple]") {
    sycl::buffer<int> buf(1);
    sycl::queue queue = sycl_cts::util::get_cts_object::queue();
    queue.submit([&](sycl::handler& cgh) {
        sycl::accessor w{buf, cgh, sycl::write_only};
        cgh.single_task<class simple_kernel>([=] {
            w[0] = 42;
        });
    });

    sycl::host_accessor r{buf, sycl::read_only};
    CHECK(r[0] == 42);
}
----

This adds a test case with the description `"a simple test case"` and the _tag_ `[simple]`.
Both can later be used to narrow down the set of test cases that will be executed during runtime.

When configuring CMake, the new test category will automatically be detected and a target with the name `test_simple` is added.
You can run the test case by executing `./bin/test_simple`.

IMPORTANT: For historic reasons, the CTS currently contains many test cases that are written in a different style.
Please see <<New-style vs Legacy Test Cases>> for more information.

=== Important Catch2 Concepts

The SYCL CTS relies on https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/[Catch2] as its underlying testing framework.
This section will list the most important concepts required to write tests with Catch2.
For a comprehensive overview of all features, please refer to the https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/tree/devel/docs[Catch2 documentation].
In addition, the CTS provides several custom utilities to extend Catch2's feature set.
See <<Special Macros & Custom Matchers>> for more information.

==== Test Case Macros

Catch2 provides several macros of varying complexity for defining test cases.
While different macros take different parameters, they all require a *description* and optionally a list of *tags* to be specified.


- `TEST_CASE` is the most basic macro, useful for test cases that deal with APIs that are not templated in any way.
- `TEMPLATE_TEST_CASE` can be provided with one or more types that are then available as `TestType` within the test case.
The test case is then instantiated separately for each type.
- `TEMPLATE_TEST_CASE_SIG` can be used to make one or more template parameters (including non-type template parameters) available under a custom name.

TIP: Use `TEMPLATE_TEST_CASE_SIG("my test", "[my-tag]", ((int D), D), 1, 2, 3)` to test APIs that support multiple dimensions.
The test case will be executed three times, with `D` having a value of `1`, `2` and `3`, respectively.

==== Assertion Macros

* `CHECK(condition)` asserts that the provided condition is true. If it is false, the assertion failure will be reported and the test case continues execution.
* `REQUIRE(condition)` works like `CHECK`, but will abort the current test case upon failure.

TIP: Use `CHECK` by default, only resort to `REQUIRE` when further execution of a test case would result in a crash (for example `REQUIRE(arr.size() >= 2); if(arr[1] == 123) { /* ... */ }`).

==== Providing Context

While Catch2 already provides great error reporting out of the box, it can sometimes be helpful to provide additional context alongside a failing assertion.

* `CAPTURE(...)` can be used to print the name and value of arbitrary values alongside a failing assertion.
* `INFO(message)` allows to provide additional information in the form of natural language descriptions.
`iostream`-style formatting is supported.

Example usages of both:
[source,c++]
----
TEST_CASE("my test case") {
    const int x = 3;
    const int y = 4;
    const int z = x * y;
    // Shorthand
    CAPTURE(x, y);
    // More verbose
    INFO("checking that x (" << x << ") times y (" << y << ") equals 20");
    CHECK(z == 20);
}
----

==== Sections

Sections provide a way of sharing code between related yet distinct testing logic.
For example this test case will be executed twice, once for each section.
While only one section is entered each time, `setup_something()` and `tear_something_down()` will be executed in both cases:

[source,c++]
----
TEST_CASE("my test case with sections") {
    setup_something();

    SECTION("testing one thing") {
        /* ... */
    }

    SECTION("testing another thing") {
        /* ... */
    }

    tear_something_down();
}
----

=== Special Macros & Custom Matchers

The SYCL CTS extends Catch2's functionality with several custom macros and matchers.

==== Compile-Time Disabled Test Cases

While writing test cases for the CTS, you may want to test features that have not yet been implemented by all of the SYCL implementations.
Test category filters (see <<Procedures>>) offer a way of disabling entire test categories for a set of implementations.
However this is often too coarse grained of an approach:
In many cases, a certain feature may exist partially in an implementation, but may not yet offer all of the APIs prescribed by the specification.
Unfortunately, using such missing APIs in test cases (for example constructor overloads or member functions) will then prevent the entire test category from compiling (for the SYCL implementation in question).
To allow testing of features that _are_ present, while not compiling those that are missing, the SYCL CTS offers special macros for disabling individual test cases at compile time.

Their usage is best explained in an example:

[source,c++]
----
DISABLED_FOR_TEST_CASE(AdaptiveCpp)("some feature works as expected", "[some-feature]")({
    CHECK(sycl::something_that_adaptivecpp_does_not_yet_support() == 123);
});
----

While for other SYCL implementations the test case will compile as if it were a normal `TEST_CASE`, for AdaptiveCpp it will instead compile to a test case that fails at runtime with the message `"This test case has been compile-time disabled."`.

Note that unlike the normal `TEST_CASE` macro, `DISABLED_FOR_TEST_CASE` requires that the body of the test is wrapped in parentheses and followed by a semicolon.

The CTS currently provides the following macros for compile-time disabling test cases:

* `DISABLED_FOR_TEST_CASE(<impls...>)(<description>, <tags>)(<body>)`
* `DISABLED_FOR_TEMPLATE_TEST_CASE_SIG(<impls...>)(<description>, <tags>, <signature>, <types...>)(<body>)`

where `<impls...>` is a comma-separated list of `AdaptiveCpp` and/or `DPCPP`.

NOTE: #**TODO:** Custom matchers.#

=== Testing Optional Features

The CTS may include tests that cannot be executed in all circumstances.
Examples of such tests include tests for optional features, tests that depend on certain device capabilities, tests that require multiple devices as well as tests for vendor extensions.
In such scenarios, Catch2's `SKIP` macro should be used to explicitly report a test case as skipped.

=== Best Practices

Here is a list of best practices for writing test cases.
These are not set in stone and are likely to evolve over time.

* Always write tests using Catch2 macros, avoid <<new-style-vs-legacy-test-cases,legacy test cases>>.
* Avoid old-style `if(!condition) FAIL("reason");` pattern.
  Use `CHECK(condition)` instead.
* Keep test cases small and focused to a single concept / behavior.
  Even a single function could be tested with several test cases.
* Use natural language descriptions for test cases:
    ** Avoid: `"host_accessor range mismatch exception"`.
    ** Prefer: `"host_accessors throws if accessed range exceeds buffer dimensions"`.
* Tag test cases according to the feature being tested:
    ** Use `[some_type]` for types that exist in the SYCL specification (example: `[host_accessor]`).
    ** Use `[some-concept]` for concepts without a clearly associated type (example: `[backend-interop]`).
* Group test cases into files at your own discretion.
  It is certainly possible to have all test cases for a given API within the same file.
  However, for larger features distributing test cases across multiple files may be preferable.
* Try to order test cases in a file in the same order as their associated API specification (if possible).

=== New-style vs Legacy Test Cases

When browsing the CTS, you will likely encounter two different kinds of test cases: **New-style test cases** and **legacy test cases**.
New-style test cases are written using free-standing https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/[Catch2] macros such as `TEST_CASE` and will look something like this:

[source,c++]
----
TEST_CASE("SYCL feature XY works as expected", "[feature-xy]") {
    // ...
    CHECK(works_as_expected);
}
----

Importantly, multiple of these test cases will typically be grouped into a single file.

Legacy test cases on the other hand use a class-based approach, where a test case is implemented by extending the `sycl_test::util::test_base` class.
Testing logic is then implemented in the `run` member function:

[source,c++]
----
#define TEST_NAME feature_xy

namespace TEST_NAMESPACE {
using namespace sycl_cts;

class TEST_NAME : public util::test_base {
public:
  void get_info(test_base::info &out) const override { /* ... */ }

  void run(util::logger &log) override {
      // ...
      if(!works_as_expected) {
          FAIL("feature XY does not work as expected");
      }
  }
};

util::test_proxy<TEST_NAME> proxy;
}
----

While legacy test cases are still mapped to Catch2 under the hood, they require a lot of boilerplate code and therefore testing logic for distinct aspects of a feature are often grouped into a single test case, making them harder to comprehend and debug.
Although technically not required, usually only one class extending `test_base` is defined per file.

IMPORTANT: Always write new-style test cases.

=== Reduced and full feature set
SYCL 2020 specifies a full and a reduced feature set. The full feature set includes all features in the core SYCL specification without exceptions, the reduced feature set makes certain features optional. To ensure that reduced feature set implementations can test conformance, the CTS option `SYCL_CTS_ENABLE_FEATURE_SET_FULL` is available, which can be set to `OFF` (it is `ON` by default). Tests for full features should be conditionally included with `#if SYCL_CTS_ENABLE_FEATURE_SET_FULL` to compile-time disable these tests for reduced feature set implementations.
