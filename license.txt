KHRONOS CONFORMANCE TEST SOURCE LICENSE AGREEMENT 


This Khronos Conformance Test Source License Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into 
by and between The Khronos Group Inc. (“Khronos”), and the signatory (“Signatory”) of 
the Khronos Group Membership Agreement (“Membership Agreement”) to which this 
Agreement is attached and made part of. 
1. BACKGROUND 
A) Khronos intends to develop Conformance Tests for its Specifications. Khronos intends to 
license the source of completed Conformance Tests to Adopters who may port the tests to 
their own platform and report the results using a process defined in an Adopters Agreement. 
Khronos wishes to use Third Party Source, Khronos Source and a variety of Signatory and 
contractor resources to create Conformance Tests. 
B) This Agreement provides access for Members to Third Party Source and Khronos Source 
solely for the purposes of developing Conformance Tests. It does not provide for the use of 
the Conformance Tests for formally testing products, or use of Khronos trademarks on 
conformant products – those rights are granted in the Khronos Adopters Agreement. 
2. DEFINITIONS 
Throughout this Agreement the following terms when capitalized shall have the following 
meanings: 
“Affiliate” means any entity that is directly or indirectly controlled by a party to this 
Agreement. For purposes of this definition, control means direct or indirect ownership of or 
the right to exercise (a) greater than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares or 
securities entitled to vote for the election of directors or similar managing authority of an 
entity; or (b) greater than fifty percent (50%) of the ownership interest representing the 
right to make the decisions for such entity. 
“Conformance Tests” means software tests by which an implementation of a Khronos 
specification may be tested for conformance, which is required for authorization to use a 
Mark in relation to identified conformant products. 
“Effective Date” means the Effective Date of the Membership Agreement. 
“Khronos Source” means source code owned by Khronos. 
“Mark” means any trademark owned or licensed by Khronos. 
“Member” means any entity that has signed the Khronos Membership Agreement. 
“Residuals” means the non-tangible and non-recorded ideas, concepts and know-how 
contained in the Source Package which are unintentionally retained in the unaided memory 
of the employees of the Signatory who have had rightful access to the Source Package 
during the Term of the Agreement without memorizing such information for the purpose of 
avoiding the restrictions in this Agreement and subsequently recalling without the need to 
refer to any material which is written, stored in magnetic, electronic or other physical form 
and such Residuals are of a nature that the acquisition of it by employees amounts to no 
more than a part of the employee’s ordinary stock of skill and knowledge. However, the 
foregoing shall not be deemed to grant to Signatory a license under Khronos’ or other third 
party’s copyrights or patents. 
“Source Package” means the combination of Third Party Source and Khronos Source. 

“Third Parties” means all third parties that have licensed source to Khronos that is 
included in the Third Party Source. For the avoidance of doubt Third Parties shall include at 
least, but not be limited to Creative Technology and SGI. 
“Third Party Source” means third party source code licensed to Khronos for the sole 
purpose of developing Conformance Tests.

3.4 Indemnification 
Subject to the provisions of Clause 6.3 (Limitation of Liability) Khronos and Signatory both

settlement of any claim, of any kind or nature whatsoever, which may be sustained or 
suffered as a result of any use by Signatory and its Affiliates of the Source Package and 
Conformance Tests, including, without limitation, any act or omission, which causes or is 
alleged to cause harm or a violation of any of the rights of any third party. For the 
avoidance of doubt materials provided by Khronos and covered by this clause include the 
Source Package and Conformance Tests and any Modifications not provided by Licensee, 
and materials provided by the Licensee covered by this clause includes all Modifications

4. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS 
4.1 Assignment of Modifications 
Signatory and its Affiliates shall provide Khronos with all Modifications, and Signatory and 
its Affiliates transfers and hereby does assign to Khronos or Third Parties all rights, title and 
interest to the Modifications provided that Khronos grants Signatory and its Affiliates an 
irrevocable license to use, copy and modify such Modifications and further distribute without 
restriction as if Signatory owned the relevant Modifications. 
4.2 Assignment of Deliverables 
Signatory and its Affiliates may develop work items independent of the Source Package for 
inclusion into the Conformance Tests. If Signatory and its Affiliates wish to contribute such 
independent work to Khronos, Signatory shall provide such independent work to Khronos 
under the provisions of this Clause 4.2 and if Khronos includes such independent work in 
Khronos Source then such independent work shall be referred to as “Deliverables”. 
Signatory and its Affiliates expressly acknowledge and agree that the Deliverables constitute 
"work made for hire" under Federal copyright laws (17 U.S.C. Sec. 101) and accordingly 
Khronos shall own all right, title and interest in the Deliverables owned exclusively by 
Khronos and, alternatively, hereby irrevocably assigns to Khronos all ownership rights and 
irrevocably waives all other rights (including moral rights) it might have in the Deliverables. 
Signatory shall, at any time upon request, execute any documentation required by Khronos 
to vest exclusive ownership of the Deliverables in Khronos (or its designee). 
4.3 Copies 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Clause 4.2, Signatory shall be permitted to retain one (1) 
operating copy and one (1) archival copy of the Source Package, Modifications and 
Deliverables for Signatory’s internal use, including but not limited to the purpose of 
performing any required warranty service and support and testing of products designed by 
or for Licensee. 
5. TERM AND TERMINATION 
5.1 Term 
The term of this Agreement shall be coincident with the term of the Membership Agreement. 
5.2 Termination of Portions of the Agreement by Khronos 
Signatory recognizes that certain rights granted hereunder are third party rights being 
passed through, sub-licensed or otherwise granted by Khronos. Accordingly, it is 
specifically provided that Khronos may terminate any portion of this Agreement at any time 
as to any portion of the Source Package, upon the termination of Khronos’ right with respect 
to that portion, or if Khronos has reasonable grounds, without any admission of liability to 
believe that any of the technology licensed hereunder infringes the rights of any third party.

5.3 Effect of Termination 
Except in respect of the license granted under Clause 4.1, in the event of termination, all 
rights granted hereunder shall revert to Khronos and Signatory shall cease and desist all 
use of the Source Package and return full or partial copies of same in Signatory’s possession 
to Khronos, including any and all Modifications, and shall warrant to Khronos in writing by 
an officer of Signatory as to such return. Signatory’s failure to comply with the obligations 
of this Section shall constitute unauthorized use of the Source Package, entitling Khronos to 
equitable or other relief. The forgoing provisions shall not require Signatory to purge it’s 
back up or archival tapes created automatically as part of it’s corporate IT policy provided 
that Signatory does not access or reinstall any versions of the Source Package from the 
back up or archival tapes. 
5.4 Survival 
All terms and conditions of this Agreement that, by their nature, should survive this 
Agreement will survive its termination or expiration, including those headed “No Warranty,” 
“Limitation of Liability,” “Indemnification,” “Third Parties’ Ownership Rights,” “Survival” 
“Confidential Information,” and “General”.
